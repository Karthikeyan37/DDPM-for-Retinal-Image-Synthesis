# ðŸ§  Retinal Imaging with Diffusion Models and Physics-Informed GANs

This project explores the application of **Diffusion Models (DDPMs)** and **Physics-Informed Generative Adversarial Networks (PI-GANs)** in the domain of **retinal image analysis**, focusing on vessel segmentation, disease simulation, and high-quality synthetic image generation.

## ðŸ“Œ Motivation

Retinal imaging plays a crucial role in diagnosing and managing both **ocular** and **systemic diseases**. Leveraging generative deep learning models can enhance segmentation accuracy and enable realistic disease simulation, providing new tools for clinical decision support.

## ðŸš€ Models Explored

### 1. **PI-GAN (Physics-Informed GAN)**
- Incorporates **biophysical constraints** during training.
- Strong performance in **vessel segmentation** and **synthetic image generation**.
- Achieved a **Dice Score of 0.75** on the DRIVE dataset.
- Offers **faster training** and generates **physiologically accurate images**.

### 2. **DDPM (Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model)**
- Utilizes a **stepwise noise prediction** and denoising process.
- Excels at preserving **fine image details**.
- **Computationally intensive** due to iterative generation.
- Suitable for **detail-oriented tasks** in retinal imaging.
